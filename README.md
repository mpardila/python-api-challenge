Xpert Learning Asistant:
* How to create the .gitignore file
* How to append all variables at the same time by using a list of dictionaries
* How to analyze the linear regression equation

My linear regression analysis is for the equations I got by the time I did this portion of the homework. I listed the slope and the r^2 values to provide feedback. If the code is rerun, the slope and r^2 number will change, and the analysis won't be valid!
